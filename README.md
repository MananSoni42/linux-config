Configuration files for my current linux distro

I was tired of having to rewrite the same commands every time I switch to a new distro.
So, this is a place that stores common configurations that set up my terminal the way I like it.

Currently contains files and instructions for:  
* [bash](bash/)
* [vim](vim/)
