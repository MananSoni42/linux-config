Configuration files for my current linux distro

I was tired of having to rewrite the same commands every time I switch to a new distro.
So, this is a place that stores common configurations that set up my terminal the way I like it.

Currently contains
* .bashrc
  * Set up custom prompt (with git and venv support)
  * Useful aliases
  * Support for sending items to trash (tt) rather than deleting them forever (rm)
  > A lifesaver

* .vimrc
  * Support bracket matching, syntax highlighting and a better status bas
  * Compile .cpp files in vim using <F9>
  * Support for external plugins (using vundle)
